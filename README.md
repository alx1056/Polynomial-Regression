Will create a polynomial regression model based off of the data set "position_salaries"

This will test if someones can be determined solely from their position within a psuedo-company and their title/rank. 

We are given 10 titles ranging from business analyst (1) to CEO (10), we will see if polynomial regression can take in more data and determine what their position would be.
